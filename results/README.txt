OLD NOTES - PLEASE IGNORE BELOW

NOTES REGARDING TESTING RESULTS

Test Results will be saved in this folder, with each simulation in its
own folder named with format: mmmdd_testxx

All plots generated during simulation will be saved in four folders
inside the root directory for that simulation:
 > Anchor Accuracy
 > Probe Accuracy
 > Training Accuracy
 > Training Loss
 
notes.txt is a file that saves any user-inputted notes at the end of
the simulation. (I just added it because I forget what each simulation
is after I run it)

config.cfg in the root directory for the simulation is essentially a 
copy of what is used to run the particular simulation.

Final plots generated after the simulation are saved in the root
directory for the simulation.
